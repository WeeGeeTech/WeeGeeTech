# Website Testing Suite

This folder contains a collection of Python tests used to validate components and functionality of a website developed by a team of students creating a senior undergraduate software engineering project.

The page being tested is a mock online bookstore called "Book Stacks" which can be found at: https://main.d2oouagfij5oad.amplifyapp.com/

## Purpose

The purpose of these tests is to ensure that all critical components and features of the website function as expected. They help in identifying and addressing any issues that may arise during development or deployment. Components being tested are included within the file name. Details can be found within comments of each file.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine. Be sure you have Python installed.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the documents and install any required dependencies (e.g. Selenium)

## Running Tests

To run the tests, Navigate to the Book Stacks site and create a new account. Note your username and password, as they will be required to run many of the tests.
Open the Python files in your editor. For tests that require an account, replace the username "uuuuuu" with your username, and replace the password "pppppp" with your actual password. For tests requiring a login account, you should only have to replace the username and password once within each script.

Once the passwords have been configured, you should be able to run each test and watch it navigate to various elements of the website and test each one.
